If you want to start working on code, click on the branch:main (the drop down menu that by default says main). Then type whatever name you want your branch to have, I simply called mine Emile. It will show an option create branch. Click this. Now you have your own copy of the main branch. In this copy you can freely edit and write code. Once you have finished or improved code it should be able to commit it to the main branch i.e. incorporate it in the main branch. I haven't looked at how yet but it should be straight forward.
